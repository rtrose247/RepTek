The individual copyright holders retain their respective copyrights/trademark, with 
derived images used with permissions pending, in an effort to promote research into the subject
of what an "open source" game and animation engine *might* look like. Fair use is intended, for the purpose of creating a "parody" of subject matter.
This is partly driven by Google(TM) keword+image searches, 
where "found" art images that may be subject to copyright, whereas the result of the Google(TM) search result is being shared with the idea that the "parody" material is "copyleft", modifiable, and share-able; 
such as e.g., 
searching for "futuristic interiors, futuristic exteriors, BR game, C# BR game", etc.
The collection/gameplay is mostly inspired by "Blade Runner: Rep-Detect" (2012) by Designer I. J. Thompson,
an "unlicensed/unauthorized" creation with a corresponding module that can be played in the VASSAL game engine.
Besides aiming to create a more "native" and potentially cross-platform-esque game/animations,
there is a long-term, over-arching goal of fostering reseach into gaming and
filling in an expanded story/universe, which is anticipated to draw support from the artistic and community.
This seems to suggest, also, that the choice of license may need to be left deferred, also, pending the results of the search.
