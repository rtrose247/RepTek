Retro Blade Runner Game....
Sadly, this isn’t a real game someone created, but just an all-too-brief animation. So, we still have no 8-bit or 16-bit Blade Runner game. All we’ve got is this PC version. Please, someone make this happen. I know that there is some talented person out there somewhere who can do it.

The newly-launched Lenovo Mirage Solo is the first-ever standalone Daydream headset, so Google wants to make sure you've got stuff to do with it. Partnering with Alcon Media Group, it has unveiled Blade Runner: Revelations, a VR experience set in the Blade Runner universe. You'll play the role of seasoned blade runner Harper solving the mystery behind some kind of replicant plot, using resources like a flying spinner, blaster and Esper image reconstruction.

The game is one of the first to take advantage of WorldSense, Google's new position tracking tech that works without any external sensors. The game uses it to let you "duck, dodge and lean, and step backwards, forwards and side to side, unlocking new gameplay elements that bring the world of Blade Runner to life," Alcon explains in a news release.

The Mirage Solo offers six degrees of freedom like with an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, but with the added bonus of no cables to trip over or external sensors to worry about (you still need to be careful though, obviously). There's also no need for a smartphone, which means no annoying notifications.

Blade Runner: Revelations was created by Seismic Studios, working with Google, and is "best experienced with the Lenovo Mirage Solo," the studio says -- hopefully, you can also play it on other Daydream headsets, though. Expect it to arrive sometime this spring at the same time around the new headset.

In its most general sense, a fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and “transformative” purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner.Apr 4, 2013


Parody

A parody is a work that ridicules another, usually well-known work, by imitating it in a comic way. Judges understand that, by its nature, parody demands some taking from the original work being parodied. Unlike other forms of fair use, a fairly extensive use of the original work is permitted in a parody in order to “conjure up” the original.

Well here's a bit of fan art as the new film is now out, my own take on the visual style of the Blade Runner theme. Personally the original film is very important to me, I first saw it when I was 11 years old and still remember been utterly amazed by the visual and sound design of the film. Its something that has always stayed with me and has helped shape the foundations of my own visual style and design language.

'A new life awaits you on the off world colonies!'
