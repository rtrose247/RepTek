- C# graph code => adjacency matrix for (traffic|path finding)
-
Overlapping mini-games:
e.g.,
Monopoly
Life
Rep Detect
Conway's Life (<= generation)
Towers of Hanoi

etc.
---
Grids- on demand
G.O.D.
Need:
e.g.,
Orientation angles
axis spec
location (in 'space')
drawing loop

'Grids'
=> rules ; turns
e.g.,,
=> card games | Tarot | Astrol Sim |  
'behavioral'/adaptive chess |
voigt kampf sim |
karate chess | 'hangman' life system |
apt floor sweep | 
(maybe)
scenarios : {
	school | traffic stop at intersection (red light(s) / green light(s)
	gas station |
	warehouse sim(s) |

}
etc.

Background =>
Hierarchical Hexmap Tessellations ('HHTs')
or, in the more general case,
hierarchical space filling composites
=> mazes

(maybe) some algo's:
Convex Hull
Delauney|Voronoi
"Toy" FEA <= finite element analysis | mesh tools

- random conflict generator
- 
path-finding
physics
etc.
