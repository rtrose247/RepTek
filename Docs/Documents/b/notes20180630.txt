e	exteriors
m	medieval(castles,etc.)
w	westwood bladerunner game set
r	futuristic runway show|runway show => many h*
s	space


a simple labeling classification scheme
e.g.,
i/e	interior/exterior
v/p	vehicle/player(person) passable

ip	interior|person only
ipv	interior|person or vehicle 

ep	exterior|person
ev	exterior|vehicle
epv	exterior|person/vehicle

b	billboard poster (will be seen on exterior surface)


some ideas on ip/ep/ipv/epv
- sometimes may be possible to try doing a "wildcard"
change ip=>ipv|epv, ep=>ipv|epv
"experimental" may lead to cue spinner in wrong display. could look "funny" in many cases....

(+)
character names:
list of names of major characters if present
h|npc=>humanoids only

"dogs playing poker" theme
can be
ip
or
b=>billboard (exterior)

here is a simple idea:
"image classification" game
please classify the current view as 
-interior
-exterior
-billboard/poster
=> bonus points

(c) might be a combat scene

maybe:
inspect:character=>dialog
inspect:character=>dialog|card
or
=>(c)ombat
