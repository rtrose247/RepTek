Q* quantize all images
S* storyboard
T|F* forest=> DDCF | data-driven control flow(!) | decision-tree
F(*) face animations
F|C  face|chara
Sc|Sg()	
scaling|segmentation

[]image analysis....
[]inset compositing, e.g. 4:1
[]hexbin composites


[C] image convolution....
e.g.,
"Deep Dream"

i interiors
e exteriors
m medieval
s space
w main sequence/westood/world => "go global"

a()alpha blending
C* cubes
G* grids
H* hash codes
h  hexmap|hilbert's|...
m  models|music|...
fg|bg foreground|background|...
(maybe...) "loki's minions" LOL

(C) clustering via: histograms/some sorting by hand
=> image compositing/alpha/blending
=> scene transitions (e.g., "guassian" blur effects....)
=> (maybe) image stitching....
=> uniq|tree pruning|QC quality check
=> filename driven|menu lookup(s)

image names retained(<=mostly)
a sort-of, ad hoc(?) "expert" system

or, alternatively,
"deep dive" into BR universe/image training set

e.g.,
"learning" to animate


chara lib
=> face|grids

...
"Emgu CV/C#" maybe can help....
...

OpenCVsharp

----
(maybe):
download westwood videos
analyze key frames ("I" frames)
quantize
(maybe)
sample some of the audio
e.g.,
opening title...etc.

re-package as quantized video +/- audio
need ffmpeg tool/s

----
1st
animated scene
could be-
player gets badge.
ID/wallet.
PD gun.
(extras) coat. change of clothes.
briefcase.


then...
semi-random forks,
"memory twist" game-
e.g., think auto-layout
C* C6

some "maze" aspects

power-ups:
vest.


patrol the "streets"
with interesting exteriors.neat interiors.
humanoids. and cars
e.g.,
each location has a grid
can be a high-rise lattice
may also contain nested ringed structure(s)...
e.g.,similar to rep-detect

a possibility:
random recombinant human/REP pictures<=image compositing
simplest:4 quadrant...later, hexbin

looking for any signs of REP activity
=>triggers a dialog/combat....

(maybe):
put anime/chara face animations on human pics.

need:more cat chara => talking cats
and dogs
think, C|H|A|R|D

maybe can try some models
like in FF7

maybe also try with
anime/chara faces drawn as quad

image compositing idea may also
become new twist on the image analysis/esper idea
e.g., looking for clues maybe involves "unmasking" some images
that have more than one layer => "holograph" instead of a photograph....

renderings of humanoids on futuristic backgrounds(i/e 's)
maybe also
(m) medieval
(s) space
with *height rules*
