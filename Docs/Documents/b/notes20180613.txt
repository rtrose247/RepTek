auto-layout grids;
bezier patches;

image compositing <= analysis + synthesis
- e.g., SIFT/SURF features
- 4x4 grid
- (maybe) hex grid bitmap => color histograms
- hexbin'd histograms => model learning 
- 
- py+openCV
-(...)C#/openCV
-(...)C#/py+matplotlib

* research papers => opencv trecvid texture learning and image search

e.g.,


Konstantinos Avgerinakis | Computer and Communication Engineering ...
ResearchGate
Figure 3: Block diagram of the texture recognition framework: Activity Areas(AAs)
"Compute LBP-flow for each sample m"
LBP-flow(m):{LBP m|xy, m|xt, m|yt}

example workflow:
- images=>quantize palettes=>compute Im histograms=>high-level clustering=>
	hexbin'd blobs/histograms=>Texture patch model learning=>
	image synthesis(substituted/blended hexes|alpha blending)

- transfer color histo's to other images!! :)
- color histo tool/s
