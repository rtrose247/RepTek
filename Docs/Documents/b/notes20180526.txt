"BCL"
Basic Compositing language
;)
a simple, shorthand for alpha blending 2+ images and compositing
also used fors scene flow control
using a plug-in architecture, more advanced techniques/templates may be used
with application to
=> games
=> animation

(+ maybe eventually)
=> annotation
=> story-boarding
=> synthetic video
etc.

----
From Code Project:
Enscript+DOD style associative array(s)


//s
=> each game play mode is 1 // 
=> each location = at least 1 //
//
Simple Quantized Pallete => batch mode
//
=> SharpDX sound playback
//
=> Random Forest + Scene Flow Control
//
=> *** Pre-defined sequences | intro | transitions ***
=> e.g., intro | combat | outcome | transition | *
//
=> random dungeon generator
//
=> Fast Bitmap library
//
=> Enscript 
//
=> Quickfont dialog windows
//
=> 
GLGUI demo
=> hexgrid
=> Komorebi +
=> texture cubes
//
=> OpenTK picking example + cubes demo
//
=> OpenTK elevator(E*) animation
----
later, plan to composite 
----
//e.g.,
=>GLGUI(Komorebi(OpenTKTutorial6) ) )
=>GLGUI(Komorebi(OpenTK picking example) ) )
etc.

----
ToDo: all images, general, i's,e's, to be quantized in batches => 256 
----
Suggesting a random forest of images: exteriors, interiors | <= auto-layout 
- random cube stacks
- [background]
- [middle ground]<= grid/player(s)/character(s)
- [foreground] <= player/characters

*** eventually => everything will be in associative array(s) :) ***
* currently => object oriented => plan to scale
* need: parameterized arrays

Hint:
List of *gifs => render in sequence (window updates...)

accepted
In the fixed-function OpenGL pipeline, you must also Enable texture units before a texture bound to one will be applied to anything you draw.

The normal OpenGL API binding for this is glEnable (GL_TEXTURE_2D). The OpenTK equivalent would be: GL.Enable (EnableCap.Texture2D).
