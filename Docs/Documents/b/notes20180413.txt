anti-shooting game(?)
some notes on battle system:
- shooting REPs does not ultimately kill them(!)
- must do hand-to-hand combat to defeat them

----
some notes on party system:
- REPs from BladeRunner (original) can join your party
- Bad REPS must be captured
e.g.,
DJ 'Bad B Side' LOL


some notes on emotional scoring:
- simple icons => emoticons | drawn as bitmaps over character positions (or, maybe on HUD)
	=> may be transient (e.g., during dialog, or 'show thinking; suspicion' plays

- "cellular" ping possible with remote drones
- 
- primal triggers ; knee-jerk reactions
<= explanation | (maybe) game play simulation : limbic system

Story:
- humanity's struggles with pure narcissim, anxiety, depression,
- generations of conflict and, simultaneously, 
- its rebelion against virtuous god and, simultaneously, its lauding of (false?) gods
- besides weapons, genetic engineering, 
- commerce being one of its greatest achievements
- its wars, many of them hot, some cold, nevertheless the great toll on human life continued unabated,
- reaveled an urgent need for greater tolerance, greater empathy
- and while reproductive rates had peaked, still the population persisted and continued to placed undue stress on the foodchain
- which resulted in a greater state of emergency and a heightened sense of awareness globally
- after several mass extinctions, persistent droughts, anomalous weather, disrupted animal migrations, 
and disrupted/displaced crop production, finally a united front of leading scientists stepped in and instituted a plan to 
save the environment and place humanity back on a path towards global homeostasis. 
- there needed to be an upgrade in diets, and eventually, mental capabilities.
thus eating animals became outlawed.
several false starts, misunderstandings, and mostly falsely escalated, triggered conflicts between individuals, 
- religious sects, cults, and sometimes nation states ensued due to a last ditch effort to grab all of the resources.
- eventually every resource ran dry.
- after the great economic collapse that had not been witnessed since the last century -
- they said that in the year 2020,
- hindsight would be twenty-twenty, and that it would be corporate genoristy that bailed us out.
- Political parties merged and ran de facto corporate fascism and communism 
- which at first people resisted, then surrendered to the benefits gained
- in lieu of slaving away for the benefit of the public trust.

- what emerged over time was
- an increased willingness for humans to give the earth back to nature, and gradually over time
- the different nations agreed to live in increasingly
- ambitious high-rise structures, many of them constructed like "super malls", 
- allowing re-wilding 90% of earth's surface, stabilisation of animal populations and 
- increasingly successful genetic engineered crops flourished again
- after reduced strain that had been previously induced by progressive urban sprawl.
- to aid in the transition period of the waning, collapsed work force,
- they engineered an intermediate, hybrid solution
- a stepping stone towards filling the labor gap thus freeing humanity
- to pursue a common goal: commerce; seeing with a collective, enlightened mind; 
- it began with the original programmable mannequins
- Anneken's Mannequins(-TM), was the name of the first company to mass produce the early models
- they were engineered for two-fold purpose:
- to aid humanity in its search to tune emotional responses to external stimuli, as well as psychic/spiritual forces at work,
- ESPER with psionics was invented;
- Electronic Sensory Perception with Expert (Systems) Reasoning
- psionic tech was the stable, middle ground where emotional/spiritual needs of humans
- were increasingly sensed by an empathic algorithm; a 2-way receiver/transmitter that faciliated stablisation 
- of emotions and faster, easier conflict resolution;
- an increased sense of inner peace and outward awareness during these troubled times;
- and, simultaneously, a solution to a collapsed, disillusioned labor force;
- Resident Engineered Personnel, they called them, newly created laborers,
- the (REPs) were gifted with enhanced AI, superior reasoning capability and strength, and the ability to charm most humans.
- almost unexpectedly, social unrest ensued. 
- no planes were used in the attacks on Tyrell Corp(-TM).
- after a series of human/robot rebellions, including the "black out" in 2022 when
- EMP air burst over Tyrell in LA, and other major population centers, erasing most identities and system memory, worldwide. 
- Over night, progress stopped. 
- REPs became outlawed on earth.
- Years later, 2050 and after, a new line of REPs was created 
- from the remnants 
- many older model REPs survived. including several of Anneken's Mannequins(-TM).
- Several ESPER/Psionic equipped.

Sample Dialog:
----
(Briefing)
We've got another situation 

(gives scenario)

Captain: "Try not to get your a$$ hashed"
Player: "Yes, sir."

- strangely, people increasingly began to talk to each other solely with their minds 
=> mental telepathy was coming, and scientists said, humanity was not ready for it wholesale
