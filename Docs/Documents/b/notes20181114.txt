-and various online postings...
-so it would seem.
-they tended to adhere to just the closest matches....
-a strange obsession - as Dr. Tyrell called it.
-they only like what they like....

e.g.,
Hi-
I'm planning to start a women's shelter.
If you want you can help me start it. 
I believe there is not enough sanctuary for many of us these days and I feel called to support a safe,
eternally loving environment.
0$ kick start plan
Please let me know, anytime between now and 1+1/2/20XX(<=anytime).
Maybe even if you feel it's end-of-rope; temporary stay is ok. LMK. 4 details/=>maybe relay J.
or ping me; 
even if open source(cc):ok
Cheers!

now here's a point where many(most) people get uneasy:
random card draws=>
random (future) segments=>rooms+clues
and with an additional function,namely:
* unlocking ESPER functions
remember(ing): it is a cube layout function
*
with dice roll/random card draws:
-kanji hashing
-etc.
at this point, most people are rolling(!!!).

-first time poster
-long term computer enthusiast
-as one or more proposed topic(s): possibly,
-how I loved to forget re-creating everything from scratch,
-and just utilize ScummVM game engine
-to play Westwood's Bladerunner(TM) game from 1997
-fair use licensing addressed,
-a cross-platform c++ game engine presentation,

Sincerely,

Greetings Grant:
Thanks for the email-
A proposed topic for 11.15.2018 at WSU:
"REP TEK: A Cyber Punk Game in Sc(R)ummVM (cross-platform game engine)"
-set in Ridley Scott+Westwood Studio's Blade Runner(\TM\) universe
-fair use/creative commons licensing addressed
-game theory motivation(s)
-sample video keyframe analysis
-overview of Sc(R)ummVM game engine utilizing C++/SDL
-game tree analysis
-remix+engine+embedded language idea(s)
-Etc.

thinking 10-15 minutes presentaion+5m demo

Sincerely,
R.Travis Rose

P.S.
If you need a sample bio, I can draft that also....
it would be something like my "linkedin",

Kewel!

  I am running an ADS-B live mapping server on a local intra-lan
(Hamilton, Greene, Montgomery, Miami counties)
with a (very inexpensive) SDR and a Raspberry Pi.

  I have a portable SDR/ADS-B mapper that I can run on a laptop.
I could demonstrate if the ADS-B signals will penetrate the WSU building.

I wanted to teach a computer to think creatively, to have and start to develop its own imagination.
I started to wonder- what sort of scenarios, what sort of environment(s).
Maybe a remix engine?
Maybe turn it into a futuristic cyber punk game.

some idea(s):
-sample open source game engines
-ScummVM+RepTek=>Sc(R)ummVM

-video keyframe(s) approach
use ffmpeg to down-sample video:
e.g.,
	longplay3
	4fps...
	1/76 X 76000 => 1000frames
----
Output one image every second, named out1.png, out2.png, out3.png, etc. 
ffmpeg -i input.flv -vf fps=1 out%d.png

so,ok...
longplay1qv4-with-audio.mp4
3:11:10 @ 4fps = 11470(s) x 4 = 45880 frames

[1]"mini"-keyframe analysis
1/40	= 11470/40 = 286 keyframes	mkdir lp1 (<= for "lonpglay1|qv4|with audio")

Output one image every 40s, named lp001.jpg, lp002.jpg, lp003.jpg, etc. The %03d dictates that the ordinal number of each output image will be formatted using 3 digits. 
ffmpeg -i longplay1qv4-with-audio.mp4 -vf fps=1/40 lp1/lp%03d.jpg
=>
lp1286

longplay3
5:17:30 @ 4fps = 19050(s) x 4 = 76200 frames
1/66	= 19050/66 = 289 keyframes
ffmpeg -i longplay3qv4-with-audio.mp4 -vf fps=1/66 lp3/lppp%03d.jpg
=>
lp3289

[2]enhanced keyframe analysis
longplay1	11470(s)/12=>956
longplay3	19050(s)/20=>953

The warmth you feel inside will spark your passion for life. Get out there and enjoy all that life has to give. 
Look past others misgivings in order to take advantage of their expertise. 
You may not understand all the workings of a new technology, but you can figure out how to use it for your own purpose. 
Check your list and make sure you cover all the bases. 
Others will be ready to open up to you and to share all of what they have, both spiritually and physically.
