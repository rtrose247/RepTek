Q* quantize all images
S* storyboard
T|F* forest=> DDCF | data-driven control flow(!) | decision-tree
F(*) face animations
F|C  face|chara
Sc|Sg()	
scaling|segmentation

[]image analysis....
[]inset compositing, e.g. 4:1
[]hexbin composites


[C] image convolution....
e.g.,
"Deep Dream"

i interiors
e exteriors
m medieval
s space
w main sequence/westood/world => "go global"

a()alpha blending
C* cubes
G* grids
H* hash codes
h  hexmap|hilbert's|...
m  models|music|...
fg|bg foreground|background|...
(maybe...) "loki's minions" LOL

(C) clustering via: histograms/some sorting by hand
=> image compositing/alpha/blending
=> scene transitions (e.g., "guassian" blur effects....)
=> (maybe) image stitching....
=> uniq|tree pruning|QC quality check
=> filename driven|menu lookup(s)

image names retained(<=mostly)
a sort-of, ad hoc(?) "expert" system

or, alternatively,
"deep dive" into BR universe/image training set

e.g.,
"learning" to animate


chara lib
=> face|grids

...
"Emgu CV/C#" maybe can help....
