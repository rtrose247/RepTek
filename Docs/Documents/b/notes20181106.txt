-their imagined lost loves.
-...
-we think(!).
-meaning? 
-or, from the image and address searches...
-and various online postings...
-so it would seem.
-they tended to adhere to just the closest matches....
-a strange obsession - as Dr. Tyrell called it.
-they only like what they like....
-and since it was all online -
-they considered it "open source".
-same as the military.

e.g.,
Hi-
I'm planning to start a women's shelter.
If you want you can help me start it. 
I believe there is not enough sanctuary for many of us these days and I feel called to support a safe,
eternally loving environment.
0$ kick start plan
Please let me know, anytime between now and 1+1/2/20XX(<=anytime).
Maybe even if you feel it's end-of-rope; temporary stay is ok. LMK. 4 details/=>maybe relay J.
or ping me; 
even if open source(cc):ok
Cheers!

....
now here's a point where many(most) people get uneasy:
random card draws=>
random (future) segments=>rooms+clues
and with an additional function,namely:
* unlocking ESPER functions
remember(ing): it is a cube layout function
*
with dice roll/random card draws:
-kanji hashing
-etc.
at this point, most people are rolling(!!!).

LOL 
OK

thinking:
-quantum cloud function/s

Runciter's
rc01
rc02
Chinatown

----
idea(s):
-in the future,maybe...:
-crowds forming in local churches
-out of necessity
-free shelter
-running water
-electricity
-anime cut scene(s)<=girl with gun in front of stained glass window
-we see it now
-churches are reaching out more towards the public
-whereas we humans have been, or had been, trending towards the more reclusive,
-staying indoors type/s....
----
LOL
OK
----
idea/s
"bare" opening scene:skybox|battle
-inserting a custom scene with own skybox, possible battle/demo gameplay
-can opt out
-designer's cut=>"play as admin" ... probably(!)
----
Zuben logic:
zuben.cpp
(+)
re-enabling calls to Player_Gains_Control();

Zuben case(s)
12:spare/do not retire 12+
13:spare/do not retire 12+
14=>9

"new" strategy is a modified retire 21+
...with some exceptions:105|106|205|206|...

Runciter's (again...):
