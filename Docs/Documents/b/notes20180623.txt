“We are excited to be working with Next Games on this exciting new endeavor. 

The world of Blade Runner is uniquely rich ground for storytelling across a variety of platforms, 
games included.”

Blade Runner 2049 is set thirty years after the events of the first film. A new blade runner, 
LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling), unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what’s left of society into chaos. 
K’s discovery leads him on a quest to find Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former LAPD blade runner who has been missing for thirty years.

The companies released a screen shot of the game, but they had no other details or launch date. 
Next Games went public recently, and it has made mobile games such as The Walking Dead: No Man’s Land. 
Alcon Entertainment is a film production company that has made movies such as The Blind Side.

*: query expansion =>

indoor/outdoor scenes
"point blank" scenes
1-shot only "house" rules
"karma cubes" LOL || instant karma=>rampage-like mini-game
etc.

probably need:
choices(abc) + branching story line
T*=>decision tree RPG

also,maybe try, eventually:
some 3d reconstruction algorithms
