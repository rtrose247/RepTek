some ideas on ip/ep/ipv/epv
- sometimes may be possible to try doing a "wildcard"
change ip=>ipv|epv, ep=>ipv|epv
"experimental" may lead to cue spinner in wrong display. could look "funny" in many cases....

character names:
list of names of major characters if present
h|npc=>humanoids only

"dogs playing poker" theme
can be

or
b=>billboard (exterior)

here is a simple idea:
"image classification" game
please classify the current view as 
-interior
-exterior
-billboard/poster
=> bonus points

maybe:
inspect:character=>dialog
inspect:character=>dialog|card
or
=>(c)ombat

I ended up using MediaToolkit to solve a similar problem after having a ton of trouble with Accord.

I needed to save an image for every second of a video:

using (var engine = new Engine())
{
    var mp4 = new MediaFile { Filename = mp4FilePath };

    engine.GetMetadata(mp4);

    var i = 0;
    while (i < mp4.Metadata.Duration.Seconds)
    {
        var options = new ConversionOptions { Seek = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(i) };
        var outputFile = new MediaFile { Filename = string.Format("{0}\\image-{1}.jpeg", outputPath, i) };
        engine.GetThumbnail(mp4, outputFile, options);
        i++;
    }
}

Hope this helps someone some day.

The Blade Runner point-and-click adventure game still looks stunning. Westwood Studios’ 1997 adaptation was groundbreaking 
at the time for having multiple endings and a story that changed with each new choice you made. 
*But it also had some dazzling, painstakingly crafted backgrounds.*
OK

Here we go
http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Blade_Runner_(1997_video_game)

characters

Game-play
Variables at the Start

When the game is started a few random variables are determined. The variables generated will determine which endings are available. All the variables are related to whether a given character is a replicant or human, and the final replicant of act 3.

Lucy - Human or Replicant

Dektora - Human or Replicant

Gordo - Human or Replicant

Izzo - Human or Replicant

Sadik - Human or Replicant

Act III Final Replicant - Dektora, Lucy, or Gordo.


These are all randomly generated, so it is possible that all these characters could be replicants, 
or all, except one, could be human. 
There must be at least one replicant of this group because the final encounter in Act III is always a replicant.[1]

http://www.ign.com/faqs/2010/blade-runner-complete-endings-guide-1095108

ok...
so to get characters up to the "present" date...

Dr.Tyrell + JF Sebastien => either return by cloning, or their clones were killed (think about it)
thus the date FY2050 is actually possible.

note:
The guide and the walk-through reveal the "break in (to Tyrell Corp) and steal the DNA info" approach

Ray McCoy does this in certain variations of the game, and it can be used to save Lucy|Dektora

a twist:
DNA information might be used to save Roy...LOL

Behind the Scenes

The term "Blade Runner" originates not from any works by Philip K. Dick but from a little known 1974 novella by Alan E. Nourse. This novel was called The Bladerunner and in the novel, the reason for the term is given. Bladerunners (the term is one word in this novel) are black market medical suppliers for underground physicians. 
The term appears to refer to the scalpel blade, a picture of a medical scalpel is prominently on the book cover illustration. 

Yes- I read it, too.

Scalpel?
OK

Hint:
different levels can have different geometry- right?
