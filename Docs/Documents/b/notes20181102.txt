e.g.,
Hi-
I'm planning to start a women's shelter.
If you want you can help me start it. 
I believe there is not enough sanctuary for many of us these days and I feel called to support a safe,
eternally loving environment.
0$ kick start plan
Please let me know, anytime between now and 1+1/2/20XX(<=anytime).
Maybe even if you feel it's end-of-rope; temporary stay is ok. LMK. 4 details/=>maybe relay J.
or ping me; 
even if open source(cc):ok
Cheers!
