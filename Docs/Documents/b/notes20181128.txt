-plot twist(s)
-they used the personals. online.
-for what?
-everything.
-what's everything?
-cars.employment.
-water.food.shelter.
-!!!
-and...?
-you name it.
-shopping.
-pets.
-and of course(!):
-sex.
...
-they did image searches.
-for...?
-imagined lost loves.
-...
-we think(!).
-meaning? 
-or, from the image and address searches...
-and various online postings...
-so it would seem.
-they tended to adhere to just the closest matches....
-a strange obsession - as Dr. Tyrell called it.
-they like what they like....
-and since it was all online -
-they considered it "open source".
-yep. uh huh.
-...

LOL
OK
....
----
women's shelter?
....
----
....
now here's a point where many(most) people get uneasy:
random card draws=>
random (future) segments=>rooms+clues
and with an additional function,namely:
* unlocking ESPER functions
remember(ing): it is a cube layout function
*
with dice roll/random card draws:
-kanji hashing
-etc.
at this point, most people are rolling(!!!).
----
LOL 
OK
----
thinking:
-quantum cloud function/s
...
interesting(?!).

todo's:
//3D modeling scene(s)

-video(s):
-Zuben's soup=>player loses control()|stuck
-^Zuben not running out back door...bleh
-...conditional narration in China Town(1):howie lee's => (maybe) should be automatic 1st time

Runciter's
rc01
rc02
Chinatown

----
idea(s):
-in the future,maybe...:
-crowds forming in local churches
-out of necessity
-free shelter
-running water
-electricity
-anime cut scene(s)<=girl with gun in front of stained glass window
-we see it now
-churches are reaching out more towards the public
-whereas we humans have been, or had been, trending towards the more reclusive,
-staying indoors type/s....
----
LOL
OK
----
idea/s
"bare" opening scene:skybox|battle
-inserting a custom scene with own skybox, possible battle/demo gameplay
-can opt out
-designer's cut=>"play as admin" ... probably(!)
----
Zuben logic:
zuben.cpp
(+)
re-enabling calls to Player_Gains_Control();

Zuben case(s)
12:spare/do not retire 12+
13:spare/do not retire 12+
14=>9

"new" strategy is a modified retire 21+
...with some exceptions:105|106|205|206|...

----
Runciter's (again...):
fix duplicate clue issue
----
after Gaff's speech @ McCoy's apt roof:
need to enable exits()....
//=>always enable exits in Gaff:goal changed()
----
rc02
(X)"peachy"

----
"Desk"

"fixing" Yukon Hotel logic
...
game_constants.h
	kSceneCT08 = 20, // Chinatown - Yukon Hotel - Backroom
	kSceneCT09 = 21, // Chinatown - Yukon Hotel - Lobby
	kSceneCT10 = 22, // Chinatown - Yukon Hotel - Room
	kSceneCT11 = 23, // Chinatown - Yukon Hotel - Outside

a random dungeon auto-layout:
s|c3:cubestack: i*|e*|p* <interiors|exteriors|posters>
skybox(es):S|c3|. <=whatever else,e.g., near the "perimeter" of the board
maybe also:
S|c3|iep|v 	(+vehicles)
S|c3|iep|v|r	(+runway show)

I wanted to teach a computer to think creatively, to have and start to develop its own imagination.
I started to wonder- what sort of scenarios, what sort of environment(s).
Maybe a remix engine?
Maybe turn it into a futuristic cyber punk game.

minimize all feedback loops as much as possible
minimize project overhead in terms of documents/forms produced and replace it with much higher bandwidth medium, 
which is real-time (preferably face-to-face) communications among team members.

some idea(s):
-sample open source game engines
-ScummVM+RepTek=>Sc(R)ummVM

-video keyframe(s) approach
use ffmpeg to down-sample video:
e.g.,
	longplay3
	4fps...
	1/76 X 76000 => 1000frames
----
Output one image every second, named out1.png, out2.png, out3.png, etc. 
ffmpeg -i input.flv -vf fps=1 out%d.png

so,ok...
longplay1qv4-with-audio.mp4
3:11:10 @ 4fps = 11470(s) x 4 = 45880 frames

[1]"mini"-keyframe analysis
1/40	= 11470/40 = 286 keyframes	mkdir lp1 (<= for "lonpglay1|qv4|with audio")

Output one image every 40s, named lp001.jpg, lp002.jpg, lp003.jpg, etc. The %03d dictates that the ordinal number of each output image will be formatted using 3 digits. 
ffmpeg -i longplay1qv4-with-audio.mp4 -vf fps=1/40 lp1/lp%03d.jpg
=>
lp1286

longplay3
5:17:30 @ 4fps = 19050(s) x 4 = 76200 frames
1/66	= 19050/66 = 289 keyframes
ffmpeg -i longplay3qv4-with-audio.mp4 -vf fps=1/66 lp3/lppp%03d.jpg
=>
lp3289

[2]enhanced keyframe analysis
longplay1	11470(s)/12=>956
longplay3	19050(s)/20=>953

This week's scenario is highlighted by passion,excitement and the start of new relationships.  
The warmth you feel inside will spark your passion for life. Get out there and enjoy all that life has to give. 
Look past others misgivings in order to take advantage of their expertise. 
You may not understand all the workings of a new technology, but you can figure out how to use it for your own purpose. 
Check your list and make sure you cover all the bases. 
Others will be ready to open up to you and to share all of what they have, both spiritually and physically.
