Hint:
"Home" screen

like 
"home" project

*acked
this is why we are where we are-
everything, is a *ack

random dungeon generation
e.g.,
crossword puzzle => maze algo

funny quotes
rhyming
e.g.,
"hoity toity soy sauce"
etc.

----
gfx
"UFOs" <= with cloaking

----
for images
- palette swapping

//s
C#/py graphics
e.g.,
C#/python/matplotlib 
=> use matplot lib to plot a map of the world's capital cities
//
C# wrapper for *palette quantizer*
C# wrapper for console app
=> quantize images (non-GIF/non-animated)
=> (maybe) save palettes in binary/RIFF format
//note: octree method
//also used in computer graphics (frustum culling)
OpenTK+OctTree
//
Komorebi mod => "Komorebi2" 
=> gradually adding shaders
=> model a scene from "BR"
//
//
(maybe)
bgfx# 
//
//
(maybe)
C# image processing algo
e.g.,
segmentation
using k-means
"KMC" demo
//
//
C# OpenTK 
mixing still frame + animated
conditional texture quads:
animated or not
=>
      _isAnimating = ImageAnimator.CanAnimate(_image);

System.Drawing.ImageAnimator

        ImageAnimator.Animate(_image, this.OnFrameChangedHandler);

//
//=>
image processing game : find clues

//beahavioral equations
//e.g.,
(maybe) mathnet-symobolics

//
//
Demos:
Apt.
"CarRace" Road => road blasters|outrun demo
Casa-NoExe
DOD  => enscript + associative array
Solar System

//
//
//
(maybe) eventually need:
Free Cloud for games
2+ multi-player interactive games
similar to e.g., VASSAL
....
//
//
//
"Turn-based" graphics+dialog demo
=> change player position drawn in game world

Game world concept:
E* I*
=>
series of nested E(I) 
exterior+interior cubes
with, adujstable flow layout manager
=>
1. warm-up:
array layout
then, (pseudo-) mazes

2. turn-taking demo
R*
*rep*lication side-effect => generates more cubes ...
(maybe)
memory issue: start free-ing up older regions
with /backtrack/ capability
=> hence it is an artificial "memory" sim
LOL
=> idea is to help teach "imagination" to a computer with RNG
random number generation
----
//
Background music
MIDI collection
----
//D20 <= dice tables

//HexKit <= war-gaming sim <= BSG space sim

//s
sample scenes:
They are attacking our Web pages !
(OR)
The Web pages are attacking ! <= OpenTK billboarding
///
"Earn" Karma by talking to NPCs
(non-playable characters)
eventually => word-net driven dialog

//choose character <= BladeRunner "Line UP" graphics with player select
=> how to test card image

//face chara
=> load and "animate" 
=> e.g., 
combine with Enscript/QuickFont dialog windows

//Player interface, e.g., ESPER 
(+)"radial" menu display

Need:
hex editor <= working with palettes
unicode viewer <= hash codes for images

----
//s
stil-frame + animated cubes
then, array layout
then, pseudo-random maze
+ hexgrid


ShadowEngine demo => OpenTK
e.g., "Plaza-like"
Car Race|Plaza|House/casa <= has collision detection
etc.

(Eventually)
2D bitmaps (e.g., maze pics) => can render in 3D wall structures using an auto-layout
e.g.,
what if each bit = 1 unit of distance in OpenTK
(=> suggests scale may also be modeled as a factor)
(=> future use: nesting bitmaps using variable scale in an auto-layout)

platform-jumping + cubes
