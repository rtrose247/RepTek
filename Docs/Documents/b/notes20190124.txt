ToDo's
//s
additional Zuben ehancements...adding randomness

//s
improved load+save in new version (compare to subtitles "preview" and Sc master)

//s
begin simple compositing into a scene

//s
"secret" exit(s) => sequential scene loading | <= "gameshark"ing :)

----
z:
"got to mix more"=> case 1
"you not come back here .... routine?!"=> case 8
overturns pot/pan/s=>case 14
=> case 9
=> case 10
=> case 2  	| zuben heading for door
=> case 13 	| no more retire(6)
=> case 400 	| shows alley

...
McCoy's Apt
=> case 21

(maybe)
... going to start chaining 21+ goals together

----
bleh
case 12
		//=>causing unwanted scene transition...if at McCoy apt rooftop....
		//=>
		//Set_Enter(kSetCT07, kSceneCT07);
moving to retire(6)

...
in CompletedMovementTrack()
there is no such "goal 7"
=>
moving to retire(6)
(!)
disappeared
bleh
=>
moving to // | <= NOP

----
chaining cases 21+
21...400 (sequentially)

variation "2":
106=>105 (preserve 105|106 from original)
206=>205 (preserve 205|206 from original)

hmm...
not quite
----
an aside
from auto-layout idea(s)
maybe try
a variation, e.g.,
exponential-shaped distributions of cube stacks
with images sampled from i/e/r|etc.

----
down-the-road idea:
systems integration via shared memory using C#/C++/... memory streams
----
to do
//s
understand actor/actor_clues better...maybe improve init time
commenting some debug("") print output in add/remove

//s
actor animation loop(s)

interesting....
actors start with 50 hit points (HP)
waypoints
walk loops
XYZ

rc02
oops
fix mouse click()
bool SceneScriptRC02::MouseClick(int x, int y) {
	//
	//RTR 10.23.2018
	//clues are *essential* to the game:
	//
	//=>don't actually need this ....
	//:)
	if (!Actor_Clue_Query(kActorMcCoy, kClueShellCasings)) <= was kClueShellCasingsA

bleh
zuben got away!

----
zuben logic
in completed movement track
goal chaining
200|205|206|100|105|106
i.e.,
		int goal = Actor_Query_Goal_Number(kActorZuben);
		if (goal == 200) {
			Actor_Set_Goal_Number(kActorZuben, 205);
		} else if (goal == 205) {
			Actor_Set_Goal_Number(kActorZuben, 206);
		} else if (goal == 100) {
			Actor_Set_Goal_Number(kActorZuben, 105);
		} else if (goal == 105) {
			Actor_Set_Goal_Number(kActorZuben, 106);
		}

an intervention (maybe):
-don't allow player to die during debug/test....

*also, an idea:
every clue is a card|every image (e.g., i's + e's ...) is a "clue"|<=expanded rules
