Script:
Chief:
A recent accident investigation at a (refinery) has revealed the use of unlicensed replicants as laborers.
Six replicants posing as humans who had been smuggled in have now been taken into custody.
Since this report came in ESPER has gone into full alert.
ESPER is saying we have 24 hours to resolve the issue
or a potential threat to the city will likely cause
certain members of the public to be injured or killed.
The Department takes threats like this very seriously and is also at a full alert.
Although ESPER usually tries to give us a complete picture, ESPER says since it is a fluid situation and it is still evolving, the exact nature of the threat is currently classified.

Player:
That's odd. Any ideas as to why ESPER would withold anything from us?

Chief:
Unknown. We're working on getting the details. The current direction we have is to transport the evidence obtained at the site to (RepliCorp) for inspection, analyzing for clues, and to help put together our next steps. We will relay any new leads from ESPER as they emerge.

WIRED:
Uber's Plan to Launch Flying Cars in LA by 2020 Really Could Take Off
By Jack Stewart

"After grabbing an elevator, passengers will tap their phones to pass through a turnstile and access the roof. Presumably they’ve been prescreened, because there’s no airport-style security in evidence. An agent in an orange vest takes a group of four passengers out to the waiting aircraft. There’s a pilot up front, and a small overhead display with the estimated arrival time. Then it’s just sit back, relax, and chuckle at the suckers stuck in the old-timey traffic far below."
