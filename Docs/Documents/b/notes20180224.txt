"futuristic interiors" search

(m)edieval
medieval+medieval castle


----
3d
exterior
psuedo-random generation:
layout
# bldgs
bridges

random,scattered cubes

also, some scenarios 
stacked bridges:
e.g., road block

interior
psuedo-random:
random cubes layout
# cubes
(maybe) connecting walkways

some scenarios:
stacked cubes

2+ multi-level floors


=> composite onto hex-maps

Game is:
Game map
=> exterior building shots : exterior phase
(optional) city tech rules
=> interior phase
sweep | rep detect | combat

varying combat styles:
hex-based (tactical)
up-close hand-to-hand/karate style

graphics:
bgfx | (maybe: fraubasch | nehe | irr | urho)

FX:
buildings=>cubes
particles=>smoke|rain
	glass|explosions

Etc.

Game map 
=> random city fly-over => exterior (
: can be ring of cubes along perimeter
: smaller set (1+) of texture building cubes 
: can have multiple 2+ floors <= scenario determines 
)

=> interior
: REP combat


formations
: humans
: REPs
: cars
: drones
: fighter jets
: ships


----
Modern time
e.g., 2049
"canned" exterior|interior generation
- scenario based

need:
"canned" medieval layouts
(maybe) extend random cubes algo
- Schlaraff scenarios
- scenario based

Main "search" => cube stacks 
Taller stacked cubes => increases chance of triggering combat

(later)
Composite game ideas:
Tarot+
Tarot+Astro+Chakras
"Show thinking" => REP detect
etc.

Save the Image to a MemoryStream and then grab the byte array.

  Byte[] data;

  using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())

    image.Save(memoryStream, ImageFormat.Bmp);

    data = memoryStream.ToArray();

----

conflict generation
=> combat
=> (maybe) random drama matrix


Sclaraff'
:
Eliminate REPs from medieval history(!)
:
Then, return (or escape) to future
