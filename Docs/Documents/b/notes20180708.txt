I ended up using MediaToolkit to solve a similar problem after having a ton of trouble with Accord.

I needed to save an image for every second of a video:

using (var engine = new Engine())
{
    var mp4 = new MediaFile { Filename = mp4FilePath };

    engine.GetMetadata(mp4);

    var i = 0;
    while (i < mp4.Metadata.Duration.Seconds)
    {
        var options = new ConversionOptions { Seek = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(i) };
        var outputFile = new MediaFile { Filename = string.Format("{0}\\image-{1}.jpeg", outputPath, i) };
        engine.GetThumbnail(mp4, outputFile, options);
        i++;
    }
}

Hope this helps someone some day.

The Blade Runner point-and-click adventure game still looks stunning. 
Westwood Studios’ 1997 adaptation was groundbreaking 
at the time for having multiple endings and a story that changed 
with each new choice you made. 
*But it also had some dazzling, painstakingly crafted backgrounds.*
=>westwood preservation project?
OK
----
Here we go
http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Blade_Runner_(1997_video_game)

characters

Game-play
Variables at the Start

When the game is started a few random variables are determined. The variables generated will determine which endings are available. All the variables are related to whether a given character is a replicant or human, and the final replicant of act 3.

Lucy - Human or Replicant

Dektora - Human or Replicant

Gordo - Human or Replicant

Izzo - Human or Replicant

Sadik - Human or Replicant

Act III Final Replicant - Dektora, Lucy, or Gordo.

***
twist:
human|REP(s)
you(player)|Detective who is seen in key-framed video/images
=> chase
***

These are all randomly generated, so it is possible that all these characters could be replicants, 
or all, except one, could be human. 
There must be at least one replicant of this group because the final encounter in Act III is always a replicant.[1] 

----
http://www.ign.com/faqs/2010/blade-runner-complete-endings-guide-1095108
ok...
so to get characters up to the "present" date...

Dr.Tyrell + JF Sebastien => either return by cloning, or their clones were killed (think about it)
thus the date FY2050 is actually possible.

although,JF Sebastien(from original movie/game) likely would have died from "Methusala syndrome"
to survive, JF would need to be a new copy, or patched, or both ....

Problem:aging. Deckard and Gaff aged in 2049. 
Original movie, video game "2019" age => (_)closer to BR blackout 2022

2019-2019=...=2049 (30yrs.)

so, guess what -
you (player) are going to have to chase 'em
robotic/humanoid clones => recombinant DNA, human/cybernetic organisms (cyborgs)
back into the past (FY2019)... nab 'em...
go "back to the future...!" get it-
avoid "retiring" innocents -
*follow the prompts to avoid wrong moves*
*perform grid searches*
*investigate*
*unlock clues*

potential targets (if advised) => clones|humans|aliens|robots|cats|dogs|...
OK
----
note:
The guide and the walk-through reveal the "break in (to Tyrell Corp) and steal the DNA info" approach
Ray McCoy does this in certain variations of the game, and it can be used to save Lucy|Dektora

a twist:
DNA information might be used to save Roy...LOL

Behind the Scenes

The term "Blade Runner" originates not from any works by Philip K. Dick but from a little known 1974 novella by Alan E. Nourse. This novel was called The Bladerunner and in the novel, the reason for the term is given. Bladerunners (the term is one word in this novel) are black market medical suppliers for underground physicians. 
The term appears to refer to the scalpel blade, a picture of a medical scalpel is prominently on the book cover illustration. 

Yes- I read it, too.

Extract Audio

ffmpeg -i input-video.avi -vn -acodec copy output-audio.aac

vn is no video.
acodec copy says use the same audio stream that's already in there.

ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -f mp3 -ab 192000 -vn music.mp3

The -i option in the above command is simple: it is the path to the input file. 
The second option -f mp3 tells ffmpeg that the ouput is in mp3 format. 
The third option i.e -ab 192000 tells ffmpeg that we want the output to be encoded at 192Kbps and -vn tells 
ffmpeg that we dont want video. The last param is the name of the output file.

* change to: mp4=>mp3 audio | 500 parts (3hrs/500 ~21+/-s)

Casanova
The programming language Casanova was born at the Department of Environmental Sciences, Informatics and Statistics at  Università Ca’ Foscari Venezia by a team led by Giuseppe Maggiore, now at  NHTV Breda University of Applied Sciences.
The language is “designed around games”, in the sense that it has many features to simplify the design and development of videogames, but it can be applied to other contexts, too.


https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=casanova
...
https://github.com/vs-team/casanova-mk2

Casanova is a declarative programming language for games. It is derived from F#, thus is a member of the ML family. 
Casanova enjoys full Unity integration but can also be used with other engines and libraries. 

maybe:
F# | OpenTK

I have no issue with any developer or researcher who likes F# but 
in my opinion F# will always be a niche programming language like Prolog or LISP.

Essentially
"Prolog" has not lived up to its expectations....

"face detection game"
hmm

"getting a face"=>wins trump card(s)|...

e.g.,
face(s) detected=> protect | stun | shoot | memorize(?) |... <= moves come from "suggestion list"...

maybe, as in,
"add support" during sequence playback
....

The general premise behind the timer is to repeat some code every n.
To create the timer use this:
 System.Timers.Timer aTimer = new System.Timers.Timer();
         aTimer.Elapsed+=new ElapsedEventHandler(OnTimedEvent);
         // Set the Interval to 1 millisecond.  Note: Time is set in Milliseconds
         aTimer.Interval=1;
         aTimer.Enabled=true;
Then you implement this method:
private static void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
     {
        //Whatever you need repeated
     }
The full example can be found here:

hint:
Pascal's triangle=>stacking
...
another hint (maybe):
e.g.,
[Skybox[
e(
	8 * i<=interiors
	P: grayscale * [m 's] <=Pascal stacking
)
