Q* quantize all images
S* storyboard
T|F* forest=> DDCF | data-driven control flow(!) | decision-tree
F(*) face animations
F|C  face|chara
Sc|Sg()	
scaling|segmentation

[]image analysis....
[]inset compositing, e.g. 4:1
[]hexbin composites


[C] image convolution....
e.g.,
"Deep Dream"

i interiors
e exteriors
m medieval
s space
w main sequence/westood/world => "go global"

a()alpha blending
C* cubes
G* grids
H* hash codes
h  hexmap|hilbert's|...
m  models|music|...
fg|bg foreground|background|...
(maybe...) "loki's minions" LOL

(C) clustering via: histograms/some sorting by hand
=> image compositing/alpha/blending
=> scene transitions (e.g., "guassian" blur effects....)
=> (maybe) image stitching....
=> uniq|tree pruning|QC quality check
=> filename driven|menu lookup(s)

image names retained(<=mostly)
a sort-of, ad hoc(?) "expert" system

or, alternatively,
"deep dive" into BR universe/image training set

e.g.,
"learning" to animate


chara lib
=> face|grids

...
"Emgu CV/C#" maybe can help....

Q* quantized images

compositing
i|e||h

h=>humanoids

some image techniques,
e.g.,
gray scale
...
segmentation

(maybe...)
hough applied to h* images
...c* chara faces
...h* humanoid figure extraction | outline
or,
some faked "holographic" projections of h* might well do... 
(for a "runway show" type scenario....)

(maybe...)
here is a gimic:
cell phones
"keycards" to hideouts could be...
how about pseudo "IP" addresses?

some memories maybe in REPs. 
some maybe in manneq.

then...
random h* figures with c* chara faces dialog
...
image similarity search
e.g., matching chara to found images

eventually...
"learned" images/textures may get a unique hash code
maybe md5

other image processing ideas:
Y|Cb|Cr split effect
1=>3

a note on "runway" image samples
many are 1,2,3 then fewer are 3+...n
some are more (10+)

some simple formations may suffice.
maybe can occupy 1 or more "cells" on grid
1,2,3,4....

some of the h* set may include more i*/e*
probably should make note/re-use these

----
h=>"walking" billboard quads
+ static (actual billboards)
----
e.g.,
some rooms have grid with billboarded human figures

some walls have "poster" billboard

----
I can't really draw humanoids-
you know, people?!

What about
try this:
"nested" humanoid scene
e.g.,
4x platform/dais=>
  *
*	*
  *
+grid
  *
*+++++++*
  *

see?

OK,yeah...


----
note:
the mini-study on runway will prove useful for rendering 
other scenes with random, NPCs (non-player characters)

"walking"
maybe done via,
hover- sin(x)
mirror image lower 1/2
...
mirror image 100% L/R

finding image discontinuities- identify if it is 
more than 1 h* - in "foreground".


image collecting...
"if I can just make it to...N/triangle/whatever"
----
"Oh, cool-I made it to the next pyramid/or whatever!"
made it to row 12...out of 48(!)
