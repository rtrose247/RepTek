merge build approach:

-input 1:upstream branch repo path to engines/bladerunner
-input 2:current development path to engines/bladerunner
I
edit differences
for each file in input 1,
	compare to file(s) in input2
	-same or different:
	-same=>skip
	-different=>see if "//RTR" lines present
	-if no "//RTR"=>replace with upstream version
	-if "//RTR",
		splice:
		for each line in //RTR comment block,copy until EOL|//----
		for each line after EOL, find next corresponding line in RTR that is >5 chars and
		resume source lines from upstream until next "//RTR" diff

II
checksums
for each file in input 1,
compare md5 to the md5 for file(s) in input 2
if no //RTR line(s),
same or different:
	same=>skip
	else,replace with upstream version
