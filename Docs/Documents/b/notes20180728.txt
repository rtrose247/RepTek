I ended up using MediaToolkit to solve a similar problem after having a ton of trouble with Accord.

I needed to save an image for every second of a video:

using (var engine = new Engine())
{
    var mp4 = new MediaFile { Filename = mp4FilePath };

    engine.GetMetadata(mp4);

    var i = 0;
    while (i < mp4.Metadata.Duration.Seconds)
    {
        var options = new ConversionOptions { Seek = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(i) };
        var outputFile = new MediaFile { Filename = string.Format("{0}\\image-{1}.jpeg", outputPath, i) };
        engine.GetThumbnail(mp4, outputFile, options);
        i++;
    }
}

Hope this helps someone some day.

The Blade Runner point-and-click adventure game still looks stunning. 
Westwood Studios’ 1997 adaptation was groundbreaking 
at the time for having multiple endings and a story that changed 
with each new choice you made. 
*But it also had some dazzling, painstakingly crafted backgrounds.*
=>westwood preservation project?
OK
----
Here we go
http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Blade_Runner_(1997_video_game)

characters

Game-play
Variables at the Start

When the game is started a few random variables are determined. The variables generated will determine which endings are available. All the variables are related to whether a given character is a replicant or human, and the final replicant of act 3.

Lucy - Human or Replicant

Dektora - Human or Replicant

Gordo - Human or Replicant

Izzo - Human or Replicant

Sadik - Human or Replicant

Act III Final Replicant - Dektora, Lucy, or Gordo.

***
twist:
human|REP(s)
you(player)|Detective who is seen in key-framed video/images
=> chase
***

These are all randomly generated, so it is possible that all these characters could be replicants, 
or all, except one, could be human. 
There must be at least one replicant of this group because the final encounter in Act III is always a replicant.[1] 

----
http://www.ign.com/faqs/2010/blade-runner-complete-endings-guide-1095108
ok...
so to get characters up to the "present" date...

Dr.Tyrell + JF Sebastien => either return by cloning, or their clones were killed (think about it)
thus the date FY2050 is actually possible.

although,JF Sebastien(from original movie/game) likely would have died from "Methusala syndrome"
to survive, JF would need to be a new copy, or patched, or both ....

Problem:aging. Deckard and Gaff aged in 2049. 
Original movie, video game "2019" age => (_)closer to BR blackout 2022

2019-2019=...=2049 (30yrs.)

so, guess what -
you (player) are going to have to chase 'em
robotic/humanoid clones => recombinant DNA, human/cybernetic organisms (cyborgs)
back into the past (FY2019)... nab 'em...
go "back to the future...!" get it-
avoid "retiring" innocents -
*follow the prompts to avoid wrong moves*
*perform grid searches*
*investigate*
*unlock clues*

potential targets (if advised) => clones|humans|aliens|robots|cats|dogs|...
OK
----
note:
The guide and the walk-through reveal the "break in (to Tyrell Corp) and steal the DNA info" approach
Ray McCoy does this in certain variations of the game, and it can be used to save Lucy|Dektora

Behind the Scenes

The term "Blade Runner" originates not from any works by Philip K. Dick but from a little known 1974 novella by Alan E. Nourse. This novel was called The Bladerunner and in the novel, the reason for the term is given. Bladerunners (the term is one word in this novel) are black market medical suppliers for underground physicians. 
The term appears to refer to the scalpel blade, a picture of a medical scalpel is prominently on the book cover illustration. 

Yes- I read it, too.

Scalpel?

Extract Audio

ffmpeg -i input-video.avi -vn -acodec copy output-audio.aac

vn is no video.
acodec copy says use the same audio stream that's already in there.

ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -f mp3 -ab 192000 -vn music.mp3

The -i option in the above command is simple: it is the path to the input file. 
The second option -f mp3 tells ffmpeg that the ouput is in mp3 format. 
The third option i.e -ab 192000 tells ffmpeg that we want the output to be encoded at 192Kbps and -vn tells 
ffmpeg that we dont want video. The last param is the name of the output file.

Casanova
The programming language Casanova was born at the Department of Environmental Sciences, Informatics and Statistics at  Università Ca’ Foscari Venezia by a team led by Giuseppe Maggiore, now at  NHTV Breda University of Applied Sciences.
The language is “designed around games”, in the sense that it has many features to simplify the design and development of videogames, but it can be applied to other contexts, too.

https://github.com/vs-team/casanova-mk2

Casanova is a declarative programming language for games. It is derived from F#, thus is a member of the ML family. 
Casanova enjoys full Unity integration but can also be used with other engines and libraries. 

maybe:
F# | OpenTK

https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2015/03/01/why-i-dont-like-the-f-language/
I have no issue with any developer or researcher who likes F# but 
in my opinion F# will always be a niche programming language like Prolog or LISP.

Essentially
"Prolog" has not lived up to its expectations....

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17440555/using-timer-and-game-loop
The general premise behind the timer is to repeat some code every n.
To create the timer use this:
 System.Timers.Timer aTimer = new System.Timers.Timer();
         aTimer.Elapsed+=new ElapsedEventHandler(OnTimedEvent);
         // Set the Interval to 1 millisecond.  Note: Time is set in Milliseconds
         aTimer.Interval=1;
         aTimer.Enabled=true;
Then you implement this method:
private static void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
     {
        //Whatever you need repeated
     }

https://www.freelancer.com/community/articles/top-7-programming-languages-used-in-video-games
As you can see, developers have a wide range of tools and programming languages that they can use to start developing their games. 
But before choosing any engine or programming language, you must think about the target platforms and the target audience—could you 
imagine a teenager now sitting in front of a PC playing with mouse and keyboard? That may be the standard a decade ago, but it's not that popular anymore. 
Teenagers and gamers today are now more into “touch” 
interfaces—smartphones, tablets, and notebooks with touchscreens. 
They grew up with having touchscreen everywhere, 
so when you start to develop your game, please keep these details in mind before selecting any technology.

http://earthsky.org/space/icecube-observatory-detects-neutrino-blazar-source
The detection of two distinct astronomical messengers – neutrinos and light – 
is a powerful demonstration of how so-called multimessenger astronomy can 
provide the leverage we need to identify and understand some of the most 
energetic phenomena in the universe.  Since its discovery as a neutrino source 
less than a year ago, blazar TXS 0506+056 has been the subject of intensive scrutiny. 
Its associated stream of neutrinos continues to provide deep insights into the physical processes 
at work near the black hole and its powerful jet of particles and radiation, 
beamed almost directly toward Earth from its location just off the shoulder of Orion. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/science/space-neutrinos-blazar.html
But TXS 0506+056, the "Texas source" (of neutrinos), is very far away, some 4 billion light-years. 
It is one of the brightest objects in the universe, said Dr. Halzen.
The neutrino that set off the alarm in 2017 had an energy of some 300 trillion electron volts, 
by the units of energy and mass that physicists prefer. Which means it had been produced by a proton 
that had been a booster to that energy, nearly 50 times the energy delivered by the 
Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the biggest particle accelerator on Earth.

Call it the Large Hadron Collider in the sky. Presumably it is some kind of supermassive black hole 
rumbling in the heart of that distant galaxy. For now, how this cosmic accelerator works in detail is a mystery.

Blade Runner has been brought up several times on the ScummVM boards (
http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=1549) and it would seem that while it is within the scope of 
ResidualVM it has most of its logic hard coded. That means it would (most likely) take a lot more work to 
bring support for the game into ResidualVM than what the Grim engine has taken.

In conclusion: we would very much love to see people working on reverse-engineering Blade Runner 
(or any other game, for that matter) for ScummVM. Smile

Talk to us, and we will look if how you approach things would fit into our project credo. Since we're all individuals, we have of course 
different ideas about what those credo encompasses, meaning 
we will discuss it out and hopefully reach a conclusion everyone can live with.
We do like people to stick around to maintain the engine afterwards, instead of just dumping an engine an moving on. 
We also like do have clean, readable, maintainable code. 
Both for the maintainer's sake, and for our sake. Because 
it's always possible people get busy or lose interesting, so someone else has to take over, 
and such a person is easier found when the code is clean.

Should we reach the conclusion that your game and/or approach is not a for for ScummVM, there's always the possibilty to ask the ResidualVM 
people. They are also a nice bunch and eager to help.

As a third idea, you can of course always start your own project and use ScummVM code as your base 
(provided you keep the license GPLv2+-compatible, of course). Yes, this is a bit more daring, but still possible. 
We are also happy to help you with that endavour, and some of our people might join your project.

Of course, this is all dependant on you not being a raging arsehat, trampling on helping 
hands and burning bridges left and right... Many of us don't like helping people like that.

And now I'm locking this thread. This is getting ridiculous.

shoot/stun based on

e.g.,"Z":stun
"X" shoot

human vs. CPU <= scoring

-longer term:
over time...with player feedback (point+click)
- shoot|stun matching=>may learn if it is "human" or "REP" <= measuring bias 
- adding info: pointing on a keyframe before shooting may indicate, for future ref, 
this is a human(*:photograph=>learn)|this is a REP(*:stun)|this is a robot(*:shoot)|....

so it may be load by scummVM(?).
e.g.,
I did not actually try to load the individual animations in my code, 
but you can look at the ScummVM fork linked to in thebert’s comment above to see it in action (SliceAnimations::open). The 
header of the DAT file contains an entry for each animation, which also gives you the offset in the file (line 73 of SliceAnimations.cpp).

bool SliceAnimations::openHDFrames() {
return _framesPageFile.open(“HDFRAMES.DAT”);
}

Great! So "we" are only 3+ years behind.

BR MIXER
Command line tool to extract resources for Westwood’s Blade Runner game. Read more about it here. Source code available on Github.

*interesting*

----

main idea:
2 games in 1
combine BR97 with REP DETEC
=>
card-driven action

hint:
visiting a location triggers a video <= game state|location

----
//REP DETECT
need: cards

collection "c": cards
N=55
56: 2x Rachel: "I owe you one" card

next:
quantize these

all cards are 250x350

OK - done!

note:
In VASSAL, cards have associated sounds...
need to review card face-up/face-down rules, or maybe simplify....

bleh

I know - this has turned into somewhat of a "blockchain"
anyway - we're almost there
OK

----
essentially, need: 
-state transition, with timers
-media playback capability
-threads:player,interface,AI(enemy|npc|cooperative|.)\
-image compositing
 
looking at ScummVM+BRMixer(...)
